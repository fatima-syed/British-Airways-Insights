# British-Airways-Insights
This project is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights for the British Airways.

### Background Information
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA, which is why we will scrape review data from the web. For this, we will use a website called Skytrax.

### Analysis
Once we have the dataset, we need to prepare it. The data will be very messy and contain purely text. We will perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. Once the data is clean, we will perform our own analysis to uncover some insights. For this, we will use topic modelling, key-phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, wordcloud, pie chart and line plot which will provide detailed insight into the content of the reviews.
